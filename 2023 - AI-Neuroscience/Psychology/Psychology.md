Psychology means "Study of the *soul*". It is a scientific study of the [[Mind]] and [[behavior]]. It also includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. It is scientifically described as "*The science of behavior and mental processes*".

It often combines disciplines from [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Social sciences]].

The word "Psychology" was first used by Marko Marulic in his book _[Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psichiologia_de_ratione_animae_humanae)_ 

Given that our minds are so complex, so does the study field. It is very broad and complex. The depth of this field is comparable to biological and scientific fields since it is constantly changing and building upon itself.

**Ψ** (or [_psi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi_(Greek) "Psi (Greek)")) is a [Greek letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet") which is commonly associated with the science of psychology.

## History
Disclaimer: Psychology is just [[philosophy]] studied with the [[Metodo Cientifico]].

Psychology can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Ancient Greeks, Egypt, Persia, China and India.

Every civilization tried to explain the mystery of the [[Mind]] /soul to understand how it works and why it cause human behavior.

Many ideas came from [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] and those are the foundations to what we consider Psychology today. The Greeks were so influential that Psychology comes from the word "Psyche" which means soul. Which in essense is "Study of the soul".

In Asia, China had a long history of administering tests of ability as part of its education system. In the 6th century AD, [Lin Xie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Xie "Lin Xie") carried out an early experiment, in which he asked people to draw a square with one hand and at the same time draw a circle with the other (ostensibly to test people's vulnerability to distraction). It has been cited that this is the first psychology experiment, and, therefore, the beginnings of psychology as an experimental science.

The modern day psychology is heavily influenced by the works of [[René Descartes]] and [[Thomas Willis]] in the 1600's.

Psychology became a science in late 1800's when[[ Whilhelm Wundt]] established the first Psychological laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig, Germany.
