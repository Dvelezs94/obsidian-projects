# Structuralism
## Definition
Structuralism (1879 - 1920s) was the first school of thought in [[Psychology]] aimed to study the conscious experience.

## Approach
They thought perceptual experiences could be decomposed into elementary sensations. Structuralism tries to break down mental processes (consciousness) to their sensory components through experimentation in controlled environments inside a laboratory and asking the patients to share the experience.

## History
Founded by [[Whilhelm Wundt]] and expanded by [[Edward Bradford Titchener]]. It is a school of [[Psychology]] that seeks to analyze the adult mind (the total sum of experience from birth to present) in terms of the simplest definable components and then to find how these components fit together to form more complex experiences. 

Wundt and Titchener tried to break down the mental processes just like chemistry (substance -> molecule) into the field of human psychology. They thought perceptual experiences could be decomposed into elementary sensations. He proposed a 
controled introspection to attempt to break down the experience into sensory components.

They also were the first to draw the line between *sensation* and *perception*. Indicating that perception is a process separate but related to sensation, since 2 subjects could sense the same data, but perceive different things.

Because the idea was centered on viewing consciousness as a structure (composed by building blocks of elementary sensations into which it could be broken down into), their approach was labeled *Structuralism*

Nwadays Structuralism is no longer around, it was later replaced by [[Psychoanalytical Psychology]]


## Critics
Structuralism recevied many critics, particularly from the school of psychology, [[Functionalism]]. The main critique was its focus on introspective methods, which were totally subjective.

Because of this,structuralism quickly lost power, however their approach which was systematic and scientific (because the experiments were controlled in a lab) really impacted on the research of human behavior for future generations on psychology.
