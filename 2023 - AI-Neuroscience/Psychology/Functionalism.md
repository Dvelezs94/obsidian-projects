# Functionalism

## Definition
Functionalism (1890s-1920s), founded by [[William James]] was the second school of thought in [[Psychology]] focused on the study of the conscious experience. This school was founded right after [[Structuralism]], and their methodologies and approach were different.

## Approach
They studied observable behaviour rather than internal mechanisms. They understood that there was a lot of difficulty involved in separating the subjective and objective experiences people have. Functionalism was also greatly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]] and his theory on [[Natural selection]] by asking how the environment affects people in developing certain psychological traits which could be positive or negative. They thought all behaviour is based on an evolutionary benefit.

## History
Functionalism was replaced by [[Behaviorism]]
