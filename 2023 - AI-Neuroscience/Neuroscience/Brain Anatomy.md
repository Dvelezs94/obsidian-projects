The brain is the physical organ that makes all our mental life possible. It controls our thoughts, memories, emotions, senses, temperature, etc.. Together, the brain and spinal cord that extends from it make up the central nervous system.

Brains are made of soft tissue, which includes gray and white matter, containing [nerve cells](Neurons.md), non-neuronal [cells](Cell.md) (which help maintain neurons and brain health), and small blood vessels. They have a high water content as well as a large amount of fat (near 60% of total brain size).
