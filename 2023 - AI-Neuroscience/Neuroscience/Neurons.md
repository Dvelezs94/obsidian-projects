# Neurons
![[neuronanimation.gif]]
Also called "nerve cells" are a type of [[Cell]] which are [[electrically excitable]] through specialized connections called [[synapses]]

They are the basic unit of [[Brain Anatomy]] in all animals.

## Neuron Types

Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function.

### Sensory Neurons
Sensory neurons perceive information from [[sensory organs]]. The information is fetched from senses and sent through the spinal cord or directly to the brain.

Information flows from outside (senses) to inside (brain)

### Motor Neurons
Motor Neurons carry information from brain or spinal cord to regulate activity from muscles or glands.

Information flows from inside to outside

Both motor and Sensory Neurons live in the [[Peripheral Nervous System]]

### Interneurons
Interneurons take information from sensory neurons to motor neurons. They enable the communication between sensory and motor neurons to the [[Central Nervous System]]

Interneurons in the CNS are primarily [[inhibitory]]

In the neocortex (making up about 80% of the human brain), approximately 20–30% of neurons are interneurons
