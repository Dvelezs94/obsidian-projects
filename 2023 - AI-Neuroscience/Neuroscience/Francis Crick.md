Francis Crick was one of the researchers for the [DNA molecule structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) which is the molecule responsible for carrying the genetic instructions for the development of all living being, even viruses.

After working on DNA he moved to the field of [[Consciousness]]. In there he met [[Patricia Churchland]]. As a result of their studies they proposed theories about the function behind REM sleep and dreams. After that he worked alongside [[Christof Koch]] publishing several articles about consciousness.
