Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time.

## The purpose of Memory


## Properties of Memory
1. Associative
   Memories stored in our brains are fetched through association. Think of your memories as a giant web of "things" where you fetch information based on association rules. for example if you think of "Your home", you automatically will think of your house, your family, your pets, your room and a bunch of other associated elements to the query "Your home".
2. Constructive
   

## Stages of Memory
Memory is not understood at all. And in fact all of what is written here is subject to change. however scientists have discovered some patterns in the function of memory. They divide the memory stages into 3.
Each stage has its own mechanics. For example storing new information is done differently than retrieving. Think of them as a microservice architecture where the whole is called "memory"

#### Storing

#### Retrieving
