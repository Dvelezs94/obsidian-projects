The electron is a subatomic particle whose electric charge is **negative** ([read more about charges here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEc9Ne20hlg)). Electrons are thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. An electron mass is approximately 1/1836th that of the [[proton]].

The number of electrons in an atom is *always* the same as the number of protons.

All elements in the periodic table are atoms, and all atoms have electrons.

## Electron Shell
An electron shell might be thought of as an orbit of electrons around an atom's nucleus. Each atom can have an infinite number of shells, however shells can hold up to $2n^2$ where $n$ is the shell number. Shell name convention starts with the letter K (see image below)
