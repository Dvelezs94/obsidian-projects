# Electric Current
An electric current is a stream of charged particles, suck as electrons or ions, moving trhoguh an electrical conductor. In electric circuits the charge carriers (moving particles) are often electrons moving through a wire.

## Direct Current (DC)
This simply means electrons flow in a single direction

## Alternate Current (AC)
This type of current reverses direction periodically

For both currents we use [[Voltage (V)]], [[Amperes (Amps)]] and [[Watts]] to describe how much electrical force is being transmitted through the conductor.
