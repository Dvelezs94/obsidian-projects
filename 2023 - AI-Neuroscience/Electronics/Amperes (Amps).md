Amperage is the measure of the volume of electrons flowing. Unlike [[Voltage (V)]], amps determine how big the wire needs to be when attaching electrical components to each other. The more amps a component need, the bigger wire it requires (and generally more volts as well, but not always).

If a wire is not big enough to hold the amps, it might get so hot it could burn.
