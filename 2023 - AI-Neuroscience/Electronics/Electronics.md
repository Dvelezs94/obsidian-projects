Branch of applied [[Physics]] which combines physics, engineering and technology to deal with emission, behaviour (control) and effects of [[Electrons]]. 

## History
[[Vacuum tubes]] were the first electronic components which contorled the flow of individual electrons. The first vacuum tube was invented in 1904 by [John Ambrose Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ambrose_Fleming). They (The vacuum tubes) were responsible for the electronic revolution of the first half of the 20th century. Some of the main inventions that led the vacuum tubes were the television, radio, radar and other communication devices.

The next big next technological step was the transistor invented by [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen") and [Walter Houser Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Houser_Brattain "Walter Houser Brattain"). The transistor took over many appliances previously dominated by vacuum tubes, mainly because they were much smaller and cheaper. This was certainly after a few generations of transistors.

After that, the [[Integrated Circuit]] was invented due to complexity with thousands of transistors and cable management. The circuit integrated all that complexity into a single monolith semiconductor material.

After that the components got smaller and smaller each year, which led to integrated circuits made out of sillicon, from that moment computing units (CPUs) were born.
