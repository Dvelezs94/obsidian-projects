# Registance (**Ω**)
Eletrical resistance is a barrier caused to the current flow in the circuit. Resistance is often used to decrease the electrical current coming from the power source to components.

Resistance is represented by ohms (**Ω**)

1 ohm
1 kohm -> 1,000 ohms
1 mohm -> 1,000,000 ohms

## Calculate Resistance of component
Component:
Volts: 2v
Amps: 20 mA -> 0.02 A (20 x 0.001)

Power source volts: 5v

$R =  (Power src volts - component volts)/Amps$
$= (5 - 2) / 0.02$
$= 3 / 0.02$
$= 150 ohms$

V = Voltage
I  = Current (A mps)
R = Resistance
