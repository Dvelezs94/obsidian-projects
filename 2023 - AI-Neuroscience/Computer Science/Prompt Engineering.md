Prompt engineering in AI refers to the process of designing and creating prompts or instructions that guide an AI model (generally [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]]) to perform a specific task. 

Mastering prompt ingeneering can significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of AI model responses.

## Principles
1. Write clear and specific instructions
2. Give the model time to think

## Tactics
1. Use delimiters in the prompt (quotes, backticks, dashes, etc..) ![[Pasted image 20230508151133.png]]
2. Ask for structured output (HTML, JSON, etc..) ![[Pasted image 20230508151145.png]]
3. Ask the model to check werther conditions are satisfied ![[Pasted image 20230508151321.png]]
4. Few-shot prompting - Give successful examples of completing tasks ![[Pasted image 20230508151517.png]]
5. Specify the steps required to complete a task ![[Pasted image 20230508151724.png]]
