Dynamic programming was created by [[Richard Bellman]]. It is an algorithmic paradigm for solving complex problems by breaking them down into subproblems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems.

if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have _[optimal substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure "Optimal substructure")_.

- Algorithmic paradigm
- Seeks to simplify complex problems
- By breaking them into sub-problems
- And solving the sub-problems recursively (by a function that calls itself)
