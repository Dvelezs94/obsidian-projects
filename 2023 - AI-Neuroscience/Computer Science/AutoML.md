AutoML tries to automate all the manual and iterative process of building [[Machine learning]] Models. 
The take charge of the following
1. Data organization
2. Data labeling
3. Data ingestion
4. Model Definition
5. Model Deployment
6. Model Monitoring

AutoML systems are designed as full suites so the ML engineer can focus on designing the best model to fit the solution, instead of the operations and manual stuff.

AutoML leaders (as of 2022):
- Dataiku
- Google Cloud AutoML
- DataRobot
- H20.ai
- Auto-Sklearn
- AutoGOAL
