# Evolutionary computing
Evolutionary computing is a research area in [[Computer Science]] which employs [[Algorithm]]s inspired by Darwanian evolution principles and draws inspiration from molecular [[Genetics]].

EC is heavily influenced by [[Charles Darwin]] evolution theory and [[Natural selection]].

The basic principle is that a population is individuals is thrown to an environment where they strive for survival and reproduction. The fitness (chances of survival and reproduction) is determined by their environment
