Big O notation measures the complexity of an [[Algorithm]]

For this notation we use mathematical representations because the speed of computers will be different due to processors, so giving for example time as result will not be useful

Big O time complexity in this case is `order of n`


![[Pasted image 20220930115012.png]]
in this next case the time complexity is in `order of 1`

the order in this case is order of n squared

the order in this case is order of n squared again, remember just keep the fastest growing term
