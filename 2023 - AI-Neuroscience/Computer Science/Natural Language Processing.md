Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of [[Artificial Intelligence]]  that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP uses techniques and algorithms that enable computers to understand, interpret and generate human language **in a meaningful way**

The goal of NLP is to make computers understand us through natural language.

Nowadays NLP is used in many ways. Some common tasks are listed below
1. Text classification
2. Named Entity Recognition
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Language Translation
5. Information Extraction
6. Question Answering
7. Text Generation

There are many techniques NLP uses, but the most common ones as of 2023 are [[Deep Neural Networks]] with [[Transformers]] architectures

## History
The history of NLP goes back to 1950s, where simple linguistic rule-based intelligent systems were designed to analyze text.

##  NLP quotes:

Because NLP is such a complex problem for computers, it requires a complex solution. The answer has been found in artificial neural networks, or ANNs or neural nets for short. - Python for humanities
