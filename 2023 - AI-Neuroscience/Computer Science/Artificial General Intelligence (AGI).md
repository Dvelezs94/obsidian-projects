# Artificial General Intelligence
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand and learn *any* intellectual task that a human being can.

Right now in September 2022, so far we have [[Narrow Artificial Ingelligence]] only, but not so far in the future, maybe less than 10 years we will probably have AGI at our disposal. 

## Intelligence Traits

Some of the main features an AGI should have are:
1. [[Reason]]
2. [[Represent knowledge]]
3. [[Plan]]
4. [[Learn]]
5. [[Communicate]]
6. Sense the "real" universe (at least the one we - humans - perceive)
7. [[Act]]. Take some action that impacts the universe

## Consciousness and other human-like features
An AGI is *not* required to have consciousness, nor other human-like features like:
1. [[Consciousness]]
2. [[Self-awareness]]
3. [[Sentience]]
4. [[Sapience]]
