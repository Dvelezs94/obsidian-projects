Customers today expect frictionless curated experiences across digital channels, as they consider, purchase and use products and services.

A survey made by AWS shows that 63% of digital customers see **personalization as the standard level of service**. What this means is if you have a digital product, each user should have a unique experience.

The term "experience" has many dimensions, but in this specific case where we talk about digital products (Apps, Websites, etc...) we mean "content". The displayed content is what will be unique for each individual user.

A good example of unique experience is amazon.com. What Amazon does is they have an algorithm that learns what you like (they track clicks, viewing times, if you click on the photo of the product, if you see the reviews, etc..), then they display more of those products you like. 
All this is something that Walmart cannot do (at least on their physical stores).

Amazon's success is greatly due to that algorithm
