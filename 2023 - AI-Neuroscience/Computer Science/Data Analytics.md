Data analytics is a scientific approach of analyzing raw [[Data]] to make conclusions about that information.

Many, of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

## Why data analytics?
We live in the information era, where gigabytes of data are generated every second by companies and individuals. Such data generation is impossible to be understood by a human, and this is where data analytics comes in.

Data analytics is a method which uses scientific techniques and approach in order to understand the data (numbers) generated.

Data can tell the whole story of how a business is doing, how users are interacting with an application, how bots, markets, nations, and individuals are behaving. Analyzing the data not just gives us more understanding of the situation but also a guide on what to do next, and this is the real value.

## Benefits
- Improved on-the-fly decision making
- Understanding of your clients
- Reveal hidden behaviour patterns
- Efficient operations by streamlining processes and boosting production
- Effective targeting

## Steps involved in Data Analytics
### Understand the problem
Understand the problem is the first step. This will set scope, goal and expectations for the given problem.
### Data collection
Based on the problem definition and goal we will gather data from one or more sources for further processing. Data can be either structured, unstructured or a mix of the two. 
Data that you generate with your own methods is also considered data collection since its new data.
### Data cleaning
Having dirty data can certainly negativately impact the results you get in the analysis. This is why data is always cleaned. By cleaning data we mean having single type of data per column, have no empty rows/columns, handle outliers, represent information in a meaningful way.
### Data exploration and analysis
This is the fun part where we get to work with the data. Here we use tools to understand the data like ML algorithms, BI tools, graphs, etc..
### Interpret the results (find patterns)
The last step on the process is ideally to get a conclusion defined on the goal (the first step). This will interpret the results to find out hidden patterns, future trens and gain insights. You can also gain insight on behaviour to see how the data natually moves.
