# Computational Complexity
in [[Computer Science]] the computational complexity is simply the complexity of an [[Algorithm]] which is  the resources required to run it. By resources it means:

1. Time complexity - usual seconds, minutes, etc are not used here, instead special functions map this. [[Comlpexity theory]] deals with this
2. Bit Complexity -  number of computations/instructions that are needed for the algorithm to complete
3. Memory Usage - Amount of memory space required for al algorithm to run
4. Arithmetic Operations - This is the sum  of arithmetic operations that are performed for the whole algorithm.

Algorithm complexity is represented in [[Big O Notation]]
