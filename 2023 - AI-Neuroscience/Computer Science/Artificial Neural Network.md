What a neural network does is weight inputs to produce an output. In other words, it runs a series of operations from an input data to produce an output.

The interesting thing about neural networks is that they are software machines that are reprogrammed or 'trained' based on the inputs (data) it gets. This means that these machines can be tweaked to analyze any kind of thing in the universe that can be represented as a number.

Nowadays these machines are used in many fields, but mostly they are designed and trained to "predict" or "classify"

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Examples of prediction:
- Stock price
- Next word or character in a sentence (chatbots, [[Natural Language Processing]])
- Physics (Cars, Rockets, submarines, Misiles, Game engines)
- Medicine
- And many, many more

Examples of classification:
- Vision / Images (a whole word of possibilities and applications here)
- Audio
- Sentiment Analysis

Neural networks are basically a bunch of small mathematical functions ([[Artificial Neuron]]) working together to form a  a greater, bigger and more precise mathematical funcion (like how the power rangers join their robots to form the megazord) - see [[Deep Neural Networks]]
