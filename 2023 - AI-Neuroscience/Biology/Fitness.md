This term comes from [[Charles Darwin]] from theory of evolution and [[Natural selection]].

In [[Evolutionary Computing]] the term means the adaptation level of a candidate to its environment. The more "fit" a candidate is, the more likely it is to suvive and see the next day. It forms the basis of natural selection.
