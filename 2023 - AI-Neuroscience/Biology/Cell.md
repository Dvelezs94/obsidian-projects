# Cell
Cells are the basic unit of life. **All known life forms are entirely composed of them**. some forms of life are made of once cell; anothers contain trillions. Cell are living beings

A cell is capable of independent existence and can carry out all the vital functions for living. They take nutrient from food, convert nutrient into energy and perform specialized functions. Cells also contain hereditary material and can make copies of themselves.

All living life is 100% composed out of cells.

> Cells make up all life on earth. Their functions vary depending on their location and their species type. The structures inside a cell determine its function.

Cell Biology and Genetics are the branches of biology focused on the study of all cells structure and function.

## Cell Categories

Cells are divided into major 2 types. *Eukaryotic* organisms may be multicellular or unicellular, but *prokaryotes* are always unicellular organisms.

### Prokaryotic
This is the simplest and most ancient type of cell. They were the first form of life on Earth for billions of years.

Bacteria and Archeal cells are samples of prokaryotic cells.

### Eukaryotic
Eukariotic cells are an evolution from prokaryotic cells
Most organisms we commonly see in the day-to-day - including plants and animals - belong to this cell domain (Eukaryotic).

These type of complex cells hold small organs inside called "organelles" which perform different tasks like protein folding, energy generation, cell housing, digestion, etc.. all of this is in a single cell

## Cell Structure

#### Shared structure

Both Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic cells share these things in common.
1.  Cell membrane. It is basically the cell housing. It selectively determines what may enter or exit the cell
2. DNA. The instructions for the cell. 
3. Cytoplasm. Its the fluid inside the cell but outside the nucleus. It gives shape to the cell, organize the interior and allow connections through "highways" from organelles

#### Prokaryotic
unlike Eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells don't have a nuclear membrane protecting the DNA. They also lack organelles.

1. *Capsule* - It is the outer protective covering found in bacterial cells.
2. *Flagella* - tail-like structures that help in the locomotion (movement) of the cell
3. *Cell Wall* - The outermost layer of the cell which gives shape to the cell
4. *Plasma Membrane* - This layer sorrounds the cytoplasm and regulates the entry and exit of substances in the cell
5. *Cytoplasm* - gel-like component which is mostly water and salt, its useful for inner connectivity of the cell and shape.
6. *Ribosomes* - they perform biological protein synthesis.
7. *Mesosome* - not clear yet
8. *[[DNA]]* - hereditary material required by the next cells

#### Eukaryotic
