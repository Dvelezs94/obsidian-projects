An organic compound is any chemical compound that contain carbon-hydrogen or carbon-carbon bonds. Due to carbon's ability to catenate/join/bond with other carbon atoms, millions of organic compounds are known. 

Because of this, carbon can create complex structures and create molecules like DNA and proteins (which crucial in life). This is why ALL known life on earth is carbon-based.

We don't know if extra-terrestrial life would be carbon-based as well, but most likely it could.
