# Philosophy of perception

Some questions it tries to answer are:
- Can we directly perceive the physical world? ([[Naïve realism]], [[Indirect realism]])
- How does the mind relate to objects in the world? [[Philosophy of mind]]
- What is our ordinary conception of perceptual experience?

We know from [[Science]] that we do not really perceive (see, feel, touch, smell) the world as it really is. What we perceive is the impact of the real world in our nervous system through our senses. This is called [[Sense Datum]] or Sense Data.


**Sensation**: Datata gathered from our senses
**Pepception**: Mental operations that organize sensory impulses into meaningful patterns.
