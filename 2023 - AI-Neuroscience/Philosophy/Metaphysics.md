# Metaphysics
Mehaphysics is the discipline concerned with the fundamental nature of [[reality]]

It is considered one of the main branches of [[philosophy]] alongside [[logic]], [[ethics]] and [[Epistemology]]

Mehaphysics has many branches concerned on different parts of the whole universe we live in.

### Critics
Mehaphysics is often critized by the scientific community and other philosophers due to the abstract nature and no empirical reassoning (both of which are required by [[Science]]).
