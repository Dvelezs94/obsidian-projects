# Analytic Philosophy
Anayltic philosophy is nothing more than philosophy unsing the [[Analytic Method]]. 

Philosophy is often transfered-learned through words, however words can mean different things depending on the context and other factors. The idea behind Analytic philosophy is to connect philosophy to a methodology (in this case Analytic)

## Key ideas
1. Introduction of a methodology into philosophy to increase rigurousness
2. Great attention into empirical methods
3. Big Concern with linguistic structure
4. Understanding wholes in terms of parts (break down problems)
5. Clarity of ideas

## Symbol Logic system
One longshot for the main heros of this philosophy was to create a language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language. They wanted to achieve this through [logical operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_atomism).
