# The mind-body problem
Are mind and body separate entities?
What is the link between the mind and the body? How does that interaction happens?
What is the fundamental nature of the mind?
 
Many philosophers have tried to address this issue, with no luck at all.

It is important to say that all philosophers have their own opinion, but thats all we have right now, opinions.

There 2 main philosophical theories about this topic

### [[Dualism]]
Dualism states that the mental and the physical - or mind and body or mind and brain - are, in some sense, radically different kind of things.

It basically says that thinking and consciousness are not a physical thing.

### [[Materialism]]
Materialism states that the [[Matter]] is the fundamental subtance in nature and all things, including mental states and consciousness. Everything in the universe reduces to a physical interaction of material things. 

Materialism is closely related to [[Physicalism]]
