# Naïve realism
Part of [[Philosophy of perception]] and [[Philosophy of mind]]. Naïve realism, also known as direct realism, perceptual realism or common sense realism, is the idea that the senses we have (see, touch, smell, etc..) provide us with direct awareness of objects as they really are.

According to naïve realists, the objects of perception are not representations in our minds, but the actual real objects themselves.

**Naïve realism argues we perceive the world directly**

Naïve realism has later inspired the work on [[Visual perception]] in [[Psychology]]
