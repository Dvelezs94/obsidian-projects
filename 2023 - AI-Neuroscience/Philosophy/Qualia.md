In [[Philosophy of mind]], qualia is basically experience each of us have. Some examples could be seeing red, the experience of hearing a bird, etc, being in pain, being in love, etc...

Qualia is[ philosophically subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity), meaning it can only be experienced by the singular subject and it is also an indea or situation considered true only from the perspective of the subject. (ie. the red I see is not the same as the red you see, but we call it the same - but the experience is subjectively unique).
