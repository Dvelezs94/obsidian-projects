## The hard problem of consciousness

This is a philosophycal problem of explaining why and how humans (and maybe other living beings) have [[Qualia]] or phenomenal **experiences** which are subjective for each one of us.

This problem was first raised by [[David Chalmers]] in this paper *Facing up to the problem of consciousness* (1995)

*Why is the performance of the brain cognitive functions accompanied by experience?* - Chalmer asks in his paper on page 5.

Why doesn’t all this information-processing go on “in the dark”, free of any inner feel?

There are many theories that try to explain why do we experience in the first place, but none has worked so far.
