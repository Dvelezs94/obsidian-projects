## Cartesian Dualism

Cartesian dualism is simply Descartes concept of dualism.

### Substances
Dualism states there are 2 kind *substances* in the universe 
- Mental things called *minds*
- Physical things called *bodies*

He reasoned that the body could be divided up by removing a leg or arm, but the mind or souls were indivisible.

Descartes divided these 2 things mainly due to his religious convictions. So he left Physical things as a concern to science, and mental/soul things concerned to religion.

### Essence
He states that both substances have an *essence* which is "What makes the substance the kind of thing that it is."

#### Minds
- Conscious
- Always thinking
- Indivisible
- Freedom
#### Bodies
- Live in the physical world
- Have physical dimensions
- Are divisible
- Are determined by the laws of [[physics]]

### Problems of Cartesian Dualism
1. How does the mind relate to the body? How are they attached? [[The mind-body problem]]
2. Because the mind is indivisible, does that mean that if my body dies, my mind will still live? - given the idea that it is indivisible, which means it is indestructible.
3. How do I know that other beings have a mind? [[The problem of other minds]]
4. If the mind is free, but the body is completely determined by physics, do we have free will?
5. And many other issues...
