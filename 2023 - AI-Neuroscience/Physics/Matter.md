Matter is any substance that has [[mass]] and takes up space by having volume

Based on the definition above, it means that all that exist is made up of matter (including thoughts. Because where would they be otherwise?).

Atoms and substances are made up of matter, which is pretty much everything that exist.

The amount of matter in an object is measured by its mass   

## Physical Properties 

Any characteristic that can be measured, such as an object’s density, colour, mass, volume, length, malleability, melting point, hardness, odour, temperature, and more, are considered properties of matter.
