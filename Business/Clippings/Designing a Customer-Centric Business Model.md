Simply defined, a business model is how you deliver value to customers and how you make money in return. The most successful business models capture value in concert with the customer. In this session, originally presented in-person at the Harvard Innovation Labs, you’ll learn how to do just that. [[Michael Skok]], founding partner at Underscore VC, will share how to identify your core business value and align your business model to your customer’s success.
