Why uptinio exists?

I (Diego) always struggle with the same task, **server monitoring and real-time logging**. These are repetitive tasks that should be standardized. I should be able to get logs either from my server or container and send that to a centralized solution with as single command, as well as monitoring websites and scripts, and all this should be painless.

This is definetly an observability tool aimed to DevOps/Sysadmin engineers.
