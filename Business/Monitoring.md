is the task of assessing the health of a system by collecting and analyzing aggregate data from IT systems based on predefined set of metrics and logs. In Devops, monitoring measures the health of the application, such as creating a rule that alerts when the server is nearing 100% disk usage, helping prevent downtime. 

Where monitoring truly shows its value is in analyzing long-term trends and alerting. It shows you not only how the app is functioning, but also who it's being used over time. 


## Monitoring vs Observability

The difference hinges upon identifying the problems you are currently having (monitoring) and having a way to anticipate the problems that might happen (observability). At it smost basic, m**onitoring is reactive** and **observability is proactive**.
